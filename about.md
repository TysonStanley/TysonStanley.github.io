![Cliff]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/IMG_0442.jpg)

I am a Bio-Behavioral Data Scientist with emphases in Prevention Science, `R`, Mediation Analysis, and Mixture Modeling. My research attempts to address issues of reproducibility in science. With this end in mind, I use machine learning techniques, econometrics, Bayesian inference, mixture modeling to increase reproducibility and to investigate issues relating to adolescent health. Currently, I'm a doctoral candidate at Utah State University with an expected graduation date in the late Fall of 2017 or early Spring of 2018.

I'm a fanatic of R and data visualization. I'll post on this site with R tutorials and to introduce great functions and features that can make anyone working with data a bit happier with their life, including about packages and functions that I have written.

You can find my CV here: [Tyson S. Barrett]({{ site.baseurl }} /assets/CV/CV.pdf). You can also follow me on [Twitter]({{ site.author.url }}) or you can find my repos at [GitHub]( {{ site.github.repo }} ). Feel free to email me at <t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu> to discuss research ideas, R software development, or have questions about any of my posts.
