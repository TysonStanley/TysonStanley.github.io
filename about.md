I am a Prevention Scientist and a Quantitative Methodologist studying machine learning techniques as applied to mediation/moderation, adolescent predictors of economic mobility, and adolescent health. Currently, I'm a doctoral candidate at Utah State University with an expected graduation date in the fall of 2017. 

I'm a bit of a fan of R, statistical learning, and data visualization. I'll post on this site with R tutorials and to introduce great functions and features that can make anyone working with data a bit happier with their life, including about packages and functions that I have written.

You can find my CV here: [Tyson S. Barrett]({{ site.baseurl }} /assets/CV/CV.pdf). You can also follow me on [Twitter]({{ author.url }}) or you can find my repos at [GitHub]( {{ github.repo }} ). Feel free to email me at <t.barrett@aggiemail.usu.edu> to discuss research ideas, R software development, or have questions about any of my posts.
