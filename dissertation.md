# Marginal Mediation

My dissertation is entitled: *Marginal Mediation: A New Framework for Interpretable Mediated Effects*. It aims to provide mediation analysis meaningful effect sizes and confidence intervals when the mediators and/or outcomes are non-normal (e.g., count, ordinal, binary, nominal). Up to this point, this has not been well addressed.

### Proposal

My presentation for my dissertation proposal can be found [here](https://tysonstanley.github.io/Proposal/). It uses `remark.js` as implemented in `R` by Yihui in the `xaringan` package. Feel free to check it out.

### Defense

Once I have developed my defense presentation, I'll post it here.
