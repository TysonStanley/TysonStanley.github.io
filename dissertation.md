# Marginal Mediation

My dissertation is entitled: *Marginal Mediation Analysis: A New Framework for Interpretable Mediated Effects*. It aims to provide mediation analysis with intuitive, meaningful effect sizes and confidence intervals when the mediators and/or outcomes are non-normal (e.g., count, ordinal, binary, nominal). Up to this point, this has not been well addressed, with most of the work focusing on performing a significance test.

Once the manuscript has been accepted, I will post it here. Each aspect of the study is going to be published through various peer reviewed journals as well, so keep a look out for them.
