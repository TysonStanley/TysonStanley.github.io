- R for Data Science, Hadley Wickham, available for free at: 

**Class Objective:** <br>
This seminar/workshop will address the major uses of R for Health, Behavioral, Educational, and Social Scientists. This includes: managing data, reshaping data, exploratory and advanced plotting, functions, modeling, and automation. These will allow a student to use R to work with their own data and empower a student to learn more advanced topics about R using available resources via various websites and books. Some statistical topics will be discussed in reference to R code but a full understanding of the methods is not required. The class will follow the format of the R for Health, Behavioral, and Social Scientists book.

**Structure:** <br>
The class will be hands-on, with most of class going through the R code together. The last 10 to 15 minutes of class will be devoted to allowing students to work with their own data. The class will be divided into three main sections:

1. Creating Your Own Functions
2. Loops and Other Automation
3. More Advanced Data Manipulation and Plotting

**Grading:** <br>
This is a pass/fail course. A student will be given a passing grade if they attend 5 of the 7 class times and turn in a final project. If passed, it will appear on your transcript as a completed continuing education workshop.

**Assignments:** <br>
There is only one graded assignment---a final project. This project will be developed throughout the class. It requires a written report with aspects from each main topics of the class (e.g., working with data, plotting, modeling). This will be discussed more throughout the class.

**Students with Disabilities:** <br> 
Reasonable accommodation will be provided for all persons with disabilities in order to ensure equal participation within the program. If a student has a disability that will likely require some accommodation by the instructor, the student must contact the instructor and document the disability through the Disability Resource Center (797-2444), preferably during the first week of the course. Any request for special consideration relating to attendance, pedagogy, taking of examinations, etc., must be discussed with and approved by the instructor.
