I have written a book entitled **Rstats for Researchers** designed to help teach `R` to health, behavioral, and social scientists that have little or no experience with `R`. The online version is available at [tysonstanley.github.io/Rstats](tysonstanley.github.io/Rstats/), a paper copy and a Kindle-version copy should be available soon (I'll post a link for it on Amazon's website).
