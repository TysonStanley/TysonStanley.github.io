# My Research ID's

Currently, I have two main resources to for you to check out my published work: [**Orcid**](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-1391) and [**ResearchGate**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tyson_Barrett). Feel free to check these out and let me know what you think, especially if you'd like to collaborate.

# Research Areas

As a researcher, I am a methodologist and prevention researcher. As such, my research falls under two main areas:

1. Method development dealing mainly with integrating machine learning, econometrics, and mediation analysis.
2. Substantive research regarding adolescent health; specifically, the effects of chronic illness on mental health and economic mobility outcomes.

## Machine Learning, Econometrics, and Mediation

It is very common in the behavioral, health, and biological sciences to want to research the path that a factor takes in influencing an outcome. Given the vast amounts of data being produced about these very topics, machine learning techniques can be life-saving tools helping sort through the noise. However, little has been done in developing machine learning that also gives information on potential causal pathways.  This is where my research comes in.

## Adolescent Health and Chronic Conditions

It is very clear that adolescence is a transformative, vital stage in individuals' lives that impacts many important outcomes such as education, employment, and family/social life. When an adolescent has a chronic health condition, this can have large implications on their ability to navigate this important stage of life. My research deals with stigmatized chronic illnesses and the impact it has on psychosocial factors and on economic mobility later in life.
