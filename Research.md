# My Research ID's

Currently, I have two main resources to for you to check out my published work: [**Orcid**](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-1391) and [**ResearchGate**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tyson_Barrett). Feel free to check these out and let me know what you think, especially if you'd like to collaborate.

# Research Areas

As a researcher, I am a methodologist and prevention researcher. As such, my research falls under two main areas:

1. Method development dealing mainly with machine learning, econometrics, mediation analysis, and mixture modeling.
2. Substantive research regarding adolescent health; specifically, the effects of chronic illness and disability on mental, physical, and developmental health.

## Machine Learning, Econometrics, Mediation, and Mixture Modeling

It is very common in the behavioral, health, and biological sciences to investigate *how* one variable influences another---the process of the effect. However, there has been a disconnect between the approaches of machine learning, econometrics and mediation analysis to understanding complex data. Given my interdisplinary background, I want to integrate methods within machine learning and econometrics within mediation analysis. For example, my dissertation is about the integration of mediation analysis with average marginal effects---a common tool in econometrics. By so doing, mediation analysis can be applied in more situations with simpler, and more intuitive, interpretations.

I also see there are many ways in which machine learning and econometrics can add value to mixture modeling (e.g., latent class analysis, latent profile analysis). Although this is a very new field for me, I am beginning to take on projects to integrate these powerful approaches to understanding complex data.

## Adolescent Health and Chronic Conditions

It is very clear that adolescence is a transformative, vital stage in individuals' lives that impacts many important outcomes such as education, employment, and family/social life. When an adolescent has a chronic health condition or disability, this can have large implications on their ability to navigate this important stage of life. My research has investigated both the epidemiology of hearing loss among adolescents and interventions aimed at helping this population.
