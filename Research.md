# My Research ID's

Currently, I have two main resources to for you to check out my published work: [**ORCID ID**](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-2137-1391) and [**ResearchGate**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tyson_Barrett). Feel free to check these out and let me know what you think, especially if you'd like to collaborate.

# Research Areas

As a researcher, I am a methodologist and applied researcher. As such, my research falls under two main areas:

1. Method development dealing mainly with mediation analysis and other complex data situations (conversational data).
2. Substantive research regarding communicative disorders, including hearing loss and speech pathology.

## General Methodological Development

Two areas in which complex data are common, but approaches to analyze them are few, include mediation analysis and conversational analyses. To improve mediation analysis, I have developed a new framework for using mediation analysis in categorical and non-normal data situations. This, although in dissertation form, is being prepared for peer-reviewed publication. I have also developed software (within the R statistical environment) to simplify important aspects of the research process. With my work in perceptual training becoming more of an emphasis, I have begun working with cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA), a technique well suited to understand conversational dynamics. My work here, although still in preparation, provides an approach to using both expert clinical assessments and objective acoustic-prosodic measures to understand complex conversational phenomena. It increases the amount of information that is used in the final estimates and measures used. Ultimately, my methodological work aims to increase the measurement validity of conversational data as well as increase the interpretability and replicability of research in other complex data situations.

## Advancement in Communication Disorders

My research in this area primarily investigates hearing loss and perceptual learning in communicative disorders. Much of my work with hearing loss is at the ground level, including temporal trends in hearing loss in the United States and issues arising in data collection on hearing loss. Recently, however, perceptual learning in dysarthria has become a major aspect of my research (in conjunction with Borrie and Lansford), with several projects underway that investigate both substantive and methodological questions in the area. It is here that my mythological work and substantive interests are intimately tied. Using aspects of my methodological development work, I have begun to provide novel approaches to tools that can increase our ability to understand perceptual learning, taking into account speaker-, listener-, and task-related factors. This has extended into what is known as entrainment, an important, but difficult-to-measure, phenomenon that can occur in conversation. It appears that these new methodologies will translate into better clinical care. Ultimately, the goal for my research, although it is in very early stages, is to develop clinical tools that can help with decision making regarding the design of therapies, the therapist-client relationship, and risk-assessments of individuals with communicative disorders.
