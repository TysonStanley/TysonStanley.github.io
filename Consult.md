My small consulting company is called *Thinking Stats*. It is based in Utah, but is available to serve throughout the United States.

I have consulted on projects in education, communication sciences, economics, psychology, and biology. Contact me for a free intake appointment.

The table below highlights the ways I can (and often have) contributed to a project.
