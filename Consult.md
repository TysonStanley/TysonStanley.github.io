![Computer on Table]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/table-computer.jpg)

As a data science and statistics consultant for the last two years, I have helped with quantiative projects in psychology, education, public health, and economics (see [my CV](/blog/assets/CV/CV.pdf)). I have provided guidance on methodology and statistical use, designed and produced data visualizations for academic publication, and have been the main statistician on published works. My main expertise is in data management, data cleaning/tidying, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.
