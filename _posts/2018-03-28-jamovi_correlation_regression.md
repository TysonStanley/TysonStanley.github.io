[Jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org) is a new piece of software that makes running most basic analyses quicker, easier, and better. Shockingly, this is a *free* program based on the R programming language. It has the goal of "free and open software to bridge the gap between researcher and statistician." Needless to say, it is worth taking a look if you are doing some basic analyses and don't want to pay for SPSS or SAS, or learn how to use `R`. It provides informative tables and neat visuals. 

This post is part of a series--demonstrating the use of Jamovi--mainly because some of my students asked for it. Notably, this is using version 0.8.6.0.

Note: This starts by assuming you know how to get data into Jamovi and start getting descriptive statistics.

## Correlation





## Linear Regression
