A few days ago I announced that I had completed the requirements for a
PhD in Quantitative Psychology and (maybe more interestingly) that I had
written my entire dissertation in Rmarkdown.

Several indicated that they'd like to see the process I went through to
do this. Questions included:

1.  How I used RMarkdown for the writing,
2.  How I formatted it to match the University's formatting standards,
    and
3.  How I worked with my PI while writing with RMarkdown.

I want to answer each of these questions.

Writing with RMarkdown
----------------------

First, I want to talk about how I went about writing a dissertation in
RMarkdown. With the advent of `bookdown`, a number of people asked if
that was the tool I used to write my dissertation. Although it is a
fantastic tool that I have used [elsewhere](), I wanted the flexibility
of using pure RMarkdown. What I mean by that is that I needed to be able
to integrate Latex formatting files within the system without having to
learn the ins-and-outs of `bookdown`.

The files I'll highlight throughout this post can be found at
[osf.io/753kc](https://osf.io/753kc/). The first, and most important
file, is the only file you'll knit. It is the main .Rmd file, in my
case, called `MarginalMediation.Rmd`. The header YAML in this file looks
like this:

Most of it contains pieces that, if you've used somewhat more advanced
RMarkdown, you are probably familiar with. These include the title,
author, output, bibliography, and nocite. The documentation for this can
be found at [RMarkdown's website](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com). The
other pieces are more rare but still documented as useful YAML options
in RMarkdown. Among these, `documentclass: DissertateUSU`. This pulls
information from another file called `DissertateUSU.cls`, which
ultimately controls much of the formatting of the outputted PDF file.
This file was heavily adjusted by my colleague and me to match the
specified formatting for Utah State University (thus the dissertateUSU
name).

This file has comments throughout to highlight what each section is
doing. It includes the formatting of the title page as well. The title
page, using the `Params:` section of the YAML. It does this as, while
knitting, a file called `preamble.tex` is written through a function
that is found early in the RMarkdown file. This function comes through
the `dissertateUSU` R package on GitHub (download with
`devtools::install_github("tysonstanley/dissertateUSU"`)). After
installing the package, I recommend using the template to get going
using the approach shown below.

![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/images/template_dissertateUSU.png)

This provides a starting template for the main .Rmd file. It doesn't
include the R chunks but you can easily add those. It will look
something like that below (minus the R chunks but I recommend, as I said
before, adding them).

![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/images/dissertateUSU1.png)

For those familiar with RMarkdown, this starting R chunk (the only one
present in the template) is important for the remainder of the file.
There's a warning `## Do NOT Remove` above the
`dissertateUSU::preamble_for_title()` function. That is the function
that takes the information from the `Params:`, places them in a
`preamble.tex` file that fills in the title page information.

In the preceding image, you may have noticed the use of the R chunk
option: `child = 'abstract.Rmd'`. This means it takes the `abstract.Rmd`
file in the same directory and knits in within the main .Rmd file. That
is, the abstract file that I wrote in .Rmd, will appear within the file.

This general appraoch of using the `child =` option allows you to write
each chapter within its own .Rmd file. This allows editing and error
finding to go much more smoothly. You'll see in the OSF repository that
I have my files for all my chapters and the different front matter
(abstracts, dedication, acknowledgement, etc.).

This is how the majority of the writing went. I added the writing and
other information, including R code (which is printed in the
appendices). However, the References, the appendices and the CV at the
end of the document took a little bit of hacking to make it work right.

![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/images/dissertateUSU_ref.png)
![](%7B%7B%20site.baseurl%20%7D%7D/assets/images/dissertateUSU_ref2.png)

This "hack" required using `<div id="refs"></div>` to force the
references to be printed before the appendices and CV. Further, the
appendix files essentially grab the code used in the manuscript and,
using `echo=TRUE` in the R chunks, prints them nicely.

For the references, I used a BibTex file, in this case called
`Diss.bib`. I used Mendeley as my references manager and then exported
all of my references to the `.bib` file. This allowed me to use the
regular RMarkdown citing while using `csl: ref_format.csl` (note that it
is CSL and not CLS that is used for the formatting) to format the
references correctly (in my case APA style). This file was downloaded
from the [vast repository of csl
files](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles). I looked for
the one that fit what I was looking for, downloaded it, and named it
`ref_format.csl` and put it in my dissertation's directory.

I'm hoping between this post and the OSF repository, this provides you
with the information to start writing and formatting your dissertation
within RMarkdown.

As a final note, I recommend using RStudio Projects as well. These help
keep things more organized, especially when it comes to saving and
reading in different files.

Formatting the PDF
------------------

Formatting took a lot of Latex code that, honestly, I googled. It
provided guidance on how to make small changes to the overall
formatting. The vast majority of the formatting took place in the
`DissertateUSU.cls` with a little happening in the main .Rmd file.

I don't have time to go into detail here as most formatting is based on
Latex. Many universities have latex style files that you can use, which
can save you loads of work as the formatting will be done for you in
large measure.

Working with a Non-useR PI
--------------------------

This may have been the most challenging part of the process. If you have
a PI that knows markdown or Latex, then you should be good to go with
editing and updating the document using any number of version control
systems (like Git with [GitHub.com](github.com)). However, a vast number
of senior researchers do not use these, generally using Microsoft's
Word.

This is how my situation was. My PI at first wanted Word documents that
she could edit using "track changes." But I convinced her that, given my
desire to have a reproducible workflow and use R throughout all my
analyses, this was an appropriate strategy to avoid inputting mistakes.
It took some convincing but I outlined the errors that I was going to
avoid using this system:

1.  My tables would be made automatically and, with minor updating,
    would be publication ready. No manual input of the numbers in the
    table can not only save my time but my PI's time checking the table
    for little errors. Thus, if my analyses were correct, so were my
    tables.
2.  My figures would auto update. If I made a change or fixed an error,
    I didn't have to go update it in the manuscript. Instead, it was
    automatically updated in the manuscript itself.
3.  The manuscript, in general, looks more professional than those
    produced by Word. The formatting feels sharper, the figures are
    auto-fitted on the page (as a floating object), and the table and
    figure auto-numbering is easy to use and hard to mess up (in
    contrast to Word which I always struggle not messing up). In
    addition, the formatting is more predictable using this approach
    than through Word (e.g., Word tables can randomly go all crazy,
    leaving cells out or combining them without you asking).

These plus other R related benefits (free, open-source, the helpful
community, etc.) helped me win her over to this approach (and the fact
that she is a very reasonable researcher that I've enjoyed working
with).

With this, we agreed that I would produce the PDF files that she could
mark up and return to me with comments.

Notably, another approach we almost took on (that I think works well
too), is to produce the Word documents without too much formatting using
the .Rmd files. Then, after the initial round of edits (so that from
there, there would be fewer edits), use the well formatted PDF files for
her to see the look of the pages and make smaller edits and comments.

Overall, this is probably the biggest hang up for most individuals that
are interested in using RMarkdown with a PI that doesn't use Markdown,
Latex or R.

Conclusions
-----------

This was a quick introduction to how I wrote my dissertation using
RMarkdown. I hope it was helpful to at least get started on the road to
using RMarkdown for your own scientific writing. Please leave feedback
if you have time!
