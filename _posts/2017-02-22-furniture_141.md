The latest stable version of the `furniture` R package is `version 1.4.1`. It contains several bug fixes in addition to improvements in `table1()`.

1. `table1()` has a few new arguments including `condense` (removes a lot of the white space in the table and for dichotomous variables only reports one level), `simple` (reports only the percentage for cateogrical variables), and `row_wise` (allows the percentages to be calculated by row instead of by column).
2. A new function--`tableM()`--which provides a table 1 based on a variable with missingness. It makes comparisons based on missing and non-missing groupings. It, therefore, allows simple analysis of attrition and non-response.

Enjoy!
