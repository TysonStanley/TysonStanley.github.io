## The Center for Research Informatics

The *Center for Research Informatics* at the University of Chicago has a fantasticly thorough site helping one getting into REDCap. I highly recommend visiting [their top-notch site](http://cri.uchicago.edu/redcap-training/#manuals). I believe this is probably the most thorough collection of REDCap manuals, tutorials, and FAQs that is available. You'll find manuals (20 of them) that are specific to many common REDCap tasks. They also have several FAQs, ways that HTML code can be used, among many other things.
