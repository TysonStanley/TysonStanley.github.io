## The Center for Research Informatics

The *Center for Research Informatics* at the University of Chicago has a fantasticly thorough site helping one getting into REDCap. I highly recommend visiting [their site](http://cri.uchicago.edu/redcap-training/#manuals). You'll find manuals (20 of them) that are specific to many tasks that one does in REDCap.

They also have several FAQs, ways that HTML code can be used, among many other things.
