The **Social Data Lab** seeks to develop both methodologies and open-source tools that simplify, extend, or otherwise improve current approaches, particularly in ways that increase reproducibility and replicability of research. Thus far, projects in the lab have helped develop tools for streamlining data summarization, for automated scoring in common tests for communicative disorders, and is working on ways to ease data manipulation for those not comfortable with programming tools like R. Future projects include improving the `MarginalMediation` R package, working on optimal data summarization in tables (for descriptive statistics, model results, etc.), developing Shiny apps that simplify common data wrangling approaches, among others.
